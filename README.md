# MyLibrary - book tracker 

MyLibrary is a small book tracker allowing users to keep up to date a list of the books they read. It is a project that uses React and the library Material UI for the front. This project was to familiarize myself a Rest API, authentication functionality. To help me build the backend, I used node.js and mongoose. 

## Prerequisite 

You need to have node.js installed. 

## Try MyLibrary

To try MyLibrary : 
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/oceanesch/mylibrary.git`
* On the terminal go to the api folder: `cd api`
* Install the dependencies `npm install`
* Start the backend: `npm start`
* On another terminal go to the front folder: `cd front`
* Install the dependencies `npm install`
* Start the front: `npm start`

This will open the front of the application on http://localhost:3000

You can now either sign up and start adding some books to your shelf or login with an already existing user: 
* User email: test@test.com 
* Password: Secret!1
